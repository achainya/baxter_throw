- Rosbag position/velocity/reference/actual and compare


- What is going on with Jacobian? Trajectory is the same even though the velocities are different?

- Velocity may not matter?
- Confirmed that does not work as well with just 4 p/v/a (beg, throw-, throw+, end)
- Performance the same when commanded with N = 200 with just position (no vel, acc)
- Noticed performance degradation at N = 10, with or without velocity/acceleration

- Can change end position in all 3 dimensions (though not much in x) and still achieve throw, can change end velocity within limits and still achieve throw
